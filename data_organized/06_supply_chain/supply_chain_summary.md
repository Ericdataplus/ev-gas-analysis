# Supply Chain Data

## Critical Battery Materials

| Material | kg per EV | Price ($/kg) | Risk Level | Top Producer |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Lithium | 10 | $15 | HIGH | Australia (47%) |
| Cobalt | 8 | $30 | CRITICAL | DRC Congo (75%) |
| Nickel | 25 | $15 | MEDIUM | Indonesia (50%) |
| Copper | 85 | $8 | LOW | Chile (28%) |
| Rare Earths | 1 | $50 | CRITICAL | China (70%) |

## Supply Risk Assessment

| Material | Concentration Risk | Recycling Rate | Substitution |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Cobalt | ⚠️ 75% from DRC | 80% | LFP batteries |
| Rare Earths | ⚠️ 70% from China | 1% | Limited |
| Lithium | 3 major countries | 5% | None |
| Nickel | Indonesia growing | 70% | LFP batteries |

## Cobalt Supply Reduction Trend

| Year | Cobalt in Batteries |
|------|---------------------|
| 2018 | Dominant |
| 2020 | High |
| 2022 | Declining (LFP rising) |
| 2024 | **51% of EVs are cobalt-free (LFP)** |

## EV Material Cost Breakdown

| Material | Cost per EV |
|----------|-------------|
| Lithium | $150 |
| Cobalt | $240 |
| Nickel | $380 |
| Copper | $680 |
| Rare Earths | $50 |
| **TOTAL** | **~$1,500** |

## Key Insight

**LFP batteries (no cobalt) are taking over!**
- 75% of Chinese EVs use LFP
- Reduces dependence on DRC Congo
- Slightly lower range but much cheaper

## Battery Recycling Potential

| Material | Current Rate | Potential Rate |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Lithium | 5% | 95% |
| Cobalt | 80% | 95% |
| Nickel | 70% | 95% |
| Copper | 90% | 95% |
