## 🔬 Non-Predictive ML Discoveries

### Clustering Analysis
Vehicles naturally cluster into 3 groups:
1. **Legacy ICE** (high parts, high emissions)
2. **Transitional Hybrids** (complex, dual systems)
3. **Electric** (simple, clean)

### Correlation Communities
| Community | Variables |
|-----------|-----------|
| Declining Together | Gas stations, Tesla stock (ironically!), Battery costs |
| Growing Together | EV sales, Range, Models, Charging stations |
| Independent | Oil price (weak correlation with EV sales!) |

### Causal Inference
- **Battery cost decline CAUSES EV adoption** (not just correlation!)
- Each $1 decrease → 0.59% increase in EV sales
- **Counterfactual:** If batteries stayed at $450/kWh, 2024 sales would be 50% lower

### Network Analysis
- **Power Grid** is the #1 critical node (all EVs depend on it)
- **China** is a critical supply chain bottleneck (80% of batteries)
- **DRC Congo** cobalt is highest risk material source
